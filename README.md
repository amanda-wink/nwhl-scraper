# nwhl-scraper
Scrape NWHL Schedule and Play by Play Data in R
This is not a finished product and I'd appreciate any feedback/pull requests/suggestion/etc. I can be reached on twitter @jakef1873. If you'd like to scrape nwhl data using python I'd strongly recommend checking out https://github.com/mcbarlowe/nwhl_scraper.

Note: I've made quite a few changes since this was written and have not updated the list of all components to this project.

nwhl_scraper.R 
---------------
Functions:

roster_info - scrape roster information given game id into dataframe

team_info - scrape information on teams within a given game id

game_info - scrape background information on a game given game id

complete_game_scrape - this is the main game scrape function. Given a game id this will return a dataframe of cleaned pbp data.

compile_games - this takes in a vector of game ids and returns a dataframe of all play by play files merged together

game_summary - reads in single game pbp file and returns player totals for the game

compile_player_summary - reads in multiple games and compiles into single dataframe

schedule_scrape - given a season and optional team vector returns all game ids for the field

nwhl_gameids####.csv
--------------------

These are csv files with the gameids for each game of the season in the year named in file
